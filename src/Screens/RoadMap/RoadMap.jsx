                  doing monthly holders' votes and discussions. Lonely Bear
                  Society is a movement, we understand how supportive the nft
                  space is, and we will be the first one to incorporate mental
                  wellness into the metaverse. We want our holders to be proud

                  The founders grew up with no direction and support from their
                  families, damaging their upbringing. We don't want that to
                  happen to our community. A portion of the Stickman Diamond Club
                  collections sales will be used to put up a non-profit,
                  non-governmental organization called The Lonely Society
                  Foundation. The main goal of the NGO is to set up
                  physical/online clinics for those struggling with health
                  issues and to create a community that has the resource to
                  guide the youth. A portion of the secondary sales will be put
                  into the foundation.
